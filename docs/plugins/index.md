# Plugins

## Plugin master list

Here you will find a list of various plugins that I have produced. You will be able to use the sidebar to select the plugin you want more information about. I hope this helps.

## Compatibility Overview

I strive to make my plugins functional on multiple operating systems, along with multiple device types. However, I am unable to check every single device. Thus, I allow users to submit claims to state whether or not plugins are working.

!!! info
    Support will be ranked in the following way:

    1. :fontawesome-solid-circle-check: - Fully working, tested by developer
    1. :fontawesome-regular-circle-check: - Claim: Fully working, tested by community
    1. :fontawesome-solid-circle-question: - Partially working, tested by developer
    1. :fontawesome-regular-circle-question: - Claim: Partially working, tested by community
    1. :fontawesome-solid-circle-xmark: - Not working at all, tested by developer
    1. :fontawesome-regular-circle-xmark: - Claim: Not working at all, tested by community
    1. :fontawesome-solid-circle-exclamation: - Will not work on specific device model (due to limitations on the device)
    1. :fontawesome-solid-circle-radiation: - Untested

    This will be placed in information for individual plugin functionality, allowing you to see how this functionality is compatible on a per-action basis. Notes may also be provided dependent on the ranking.

!!! note
    In terms of hardware checks, we check plugins under functionality types rather than against specific devices. Here are the functionality types available:

    - Dial
    - Key
    - Touch
    - Panel (think the InfoBar on the StreamDeck Neo)

    When specific profiles are brought into play for plugins, these will then have compatibility checks against specific hardware.

## Unsupported hardware

I am also aware of devices that utilise StreamDeck plugins but do not directly interface with the Elgato StreamDeck software. I will not be testing these devices, and users are also not allowed to submit compatibility check information about these for the documentation.

!!! danger
    These devices that don't interface directly with the StreamDeck software are using reverse-engineering and other hacks to gain functionality. As a result, they often have quirks that cause issues within plugins. Consequently, support will not be provided if there are issues. You would have to liaise with other users outside of the server.
