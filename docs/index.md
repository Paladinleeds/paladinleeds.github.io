# Landing

## Welcome!

Thank you for coming to this site. I hope it can prove a valuable resource for help with any issues you may face with my software.

## What is this about?

This is the home of the documentation for all plugins and other tools as developed by Paladinleeds. This should allow you to self-serve help for most of your issues. If however after checking here you haven't got the answers you seek, you may reach out for help in the Discord server (see the link at the bottom right of the page)

### So what stuff am I making?

There will be plugins, along with a new C# wrapper for StreamDeck plugin development. There may also be other public projects involved, but nothing confirmed as of yet.
